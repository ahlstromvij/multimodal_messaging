## Abstract
Despite the proliferation of multimodal messaging that combines text with different kinds of visuals, few studies consider its political behavioral impacts beyond belief accuracy. By contrast, we ask whether and for whom multimodal messages move attitudes and preferences in particular directions. Using an experiment fielded in the UK (N=3,899), we examined whether factual information describing EU immigrantsâ€™ positive economic impacts on the UK, and accompanied by either data visualizations or an animated film, change immigration attitudes and preferences. We found the combination of text and visuals in either form moved attitudes and policy opinions in positive directions. This was the case even among Leave voters predisposed to hold more negative views of immigration, suggesting they were receptive to counter-attitudinal information. However, neither visual medium had impacts over and above text. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal messages containing relevant information about immigration, and present implications for communications interventions based in journalism or policymaking.
